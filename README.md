Playground project for queryDSL
-------------------------------

I 'm trying out queryDSL to access SQL databases. It may be using Spring Data in the future.

Things I' m likely to try in here:

* Different projections from the ResultSet back to POJOs
* Batch support
* Data migration / consolidation
* integration with spring data


In general: nothing production ready, but giving queryDSL a spin.
